		"content": "I'm vegan. I approached this from a health-perspective first (WFPB), which led to a gradual transition to eating more plant based foods. Then I learned about the ethical philosophies behind resisting animal exploitation and went fully strict on following veganism.\nWhen I cook for myself, I prefer to follow the principles of a whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diet as much as possible. When I eat at a restaurant, I just follow veganism but not WFPB.\nWhat is WFPB\nI don't follow WFPB 100% strictly all the time. But, these are the core principles of the WFPB diet:\n\n*Minimize animal products\nMinimize processed foods [1]\nMinimize refined sugars\nMinimize refined grains\nMinimize oils [2]\n\n* Technically, someone can follow a WFPB diet but not be fully vegan. The WFPB diet's principles say you should minimize animal products due to their health concerns. However, since I also am a strict vegan, I adhere to completely cutting out animal products. [3]\nSo what can you eat on a WFPB diet? The standard list is: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. More broadly, it's any foods derived from plants which are minimally processed. The list may sound small, but there's a lot of variation in ingredients and there is a huge variety of dishes to be enjoyed. Many, if not most (if not all) cultures around the world have dishes which are already vegan (if not WFPB) or easily modifiable to be so.\nGetting back to my own cooking philosophy -- as mentioned, when I cook for myself, I prefer to adhere to WFPB as much as possible, but I do make small exceptions on rare occasions. When I eat at a restaurant, I don't think much about WFPB[4] and I primarily focus on finding vegan options.\nExperimentation + Cooking for others\nThere's another big exception to WFPB that I make: when I want to follow a vegan but non-WFPB recipe to create something more tasty (or just tasty in a different way) than a WFPB counterpart would be, either to experiment for my own understanding of the possibilities of food and cuisine, or to create positive experiences with vegan food for friends or family or others who may be tasting the food I prepare. If I am to have a &quot;mission&quot; related to cooking, it would be to help others to see that vegan foods can be delicious.\nWFPB is very much about health and longevity for me. Veganism on its own is about doing what's right for the sake of fellow animals that can't speak for themselves - drawing attention to and making efforts to stop their unnecessary suffering and exploitation (when plant-based alternatives can provide 100% sufficient nutrition for humans)[5]. In other words: WFPB is for myself [6], whereas veganism is to help other sentient[7] beings who are in need.\nWhat I'm trying to say with the above: I'm willing to violate my WFPB principles when I'm aiming to cook delicious things for other people. I want people[8] to have as positive a perception as possible of vegan foods. Making things &quot;healthier&quot;, though I can deeply appreciate the tastes for myself (and do hope others can too), sometimes or often does not lend to the tastiest, at least in a mainstream way[9], dishes.\nWhy do I want people to have as positive as possible a perception[10] of vegan food? It's not like I think I'm going to directly convert people toward veganism like this. But even planting a seed in someone's head that maybe possible there could be a chance that they could survive with maybe even just this little percentage of a type of food that they eat, without an animal being involved, could be okay and enjoyable.\nTalking about veganism &amp; Challenging yourself\nWhether this is true or not, I imagine some discomfort, if not stronger emotion, when someone reads this and notices that I wish for more people to become vegan.\nWell, I'm not going to deny that it's true that I want more people to become vegan.\nThat's my stance. What's yours?\nCan we have an honest conversation about our food systems and ways of eating and move towards a mutual understanding about each of our perspectives?\nCan I challenge you? Are you open to being challenged?\nIs your mind open to some ideas that might be different than what you're used to? Maybe different than what you've believed for your entire life? Can you evaluate these things with honest integrity and be open to change if what you hear is logical and reasonable? Maybe you're not ready for change right now, and that's okay. But if you really stop and genuinely think about the arguments for veganism, can you honestly and truly say that you shouldn't change something?\nI'm not saying the answer should be 100% for sure one way or the other for you. But I do request, when you have the capacity to, to learn about the reasons for veganism, to question the norm, to fully and deeply engage with the issue and the discussion, and to have an open mind to the possibility of adjusting your course, if it makes sense to you to do so.\nThis is not a fully-fleshed argument for veganism. Mainly I wanted to discuss my mindset around cooking. It's inevitably tied to the vegan discussion though.\nResources about veganism and WFPB\nSince we're here, then, some resources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58 (&quot;You Will Never Look at Your Life in the Same Way Again&quot; by Earthling Ed) This is the video that convinced me to follow the ethical side of veganism (it's just a guy giving a talk, no gory imagery or anything like that). This guy's channel has a lot of interesting tabled debates about veganism that also likely swayed me and are entertaining to watch. (Can you challenge yourself to watch these and engage with what's being discussed?))\nThis is the reddit post that made me start thinking about health for longevity purposes. https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/ci5vu1/i_am_a_22_yo_healthy_male_who_wants_to_live_until/ - There's one comment in there that references the whole food plant based diet, and I'm guessing that's what seeded my exposure to WFPB. Also likely seeded my avoidance of alcohol (or at least the health aspect of avoiding alcohol[11]).\nSome other resources about WFPB diet\n\nhttps://nutritionstudies.org/whole-food-plant-based-diet-guide/ - Another guide on WFPB. This site also is a great resource for WFPB recipes.\nSummary of &quot;How Not To Die&quot;, a book that talks about the benefits of the WFPB diet in preventing and reversing many of the most common dietary-related causes of death in humans. It also includes a detailed list of &quot;green&quot;/&quot;yellow&quot;/&quot;red foods (green is healthy, yellow is foods to steer away from but okay in limited quantities, red is foods to generally always avoid) https://www.chewfo.com/diets/how-not-to-die-by-michael-greger-md-food-list-what-to-eat-and-foods-to-avoid/\nhttps://plantbasedcookingshow.com/ A cooking blog/youtube channel that strictly follows WFPB for recipes. So many great recipes that use dried dates as a refined sugar replacement in dessert recipes.\n\n&quot;processed&quot; can mean a lot of things. Cutting a vegetable is processing it. In the context of the WFPB diet, &quot;processed&quot; is usually taken to mean &quot;heavily&quot; processed or having many additives ↩︎\n\nthis doesn't mean avoid all sources of fat. You get lots of good, healthy fats from peanut butter and avocados, for example. Refined oils are empty calories without nutritional value, and can cause buildup of health issues. I acknowledge that I am not backing these claims with direct sources right now, but a search for wfpb health benefits should bring up more info about this and the other points. ↩︎\n\nI would say it's a good thing for the principles to have this laxness about not needing to go 100% vegan right away. It makes it less intimidating. It gave me the opportunity to slowly transition away from animal products, without feeling intense pressure to immediately give up all animal products, a drastic change that may have scared me away. I slowly realized that I didn't need animal products in my life, before making the full switch. ↩︎\n\nIt's just less realistic to expect restaurant dishes to be oil and sugar free, unless the restaurant specializes in that ↩︎\n\nThis is basically my &quot;why am I vegan&quot; summed up in a sentence, but I eventually will expand and write more on this. ↩︎\n\n(my own selfish desire to increase the length and quality of my life by eating as healthy as possible to reduce the chance of dietary-related illnesses later in life) ↩︎\n\nI know what you're thinking. How can I claim that animals are sentient? This is too deep of a discussion for a footnote. But I'll just say: You wouldn't like if I kicked a dog. Why? Because it displays visual evidence of its suffering. Surely a pig or cow would display something similar. And yet we (non-vegans) are okay with (albeit indirectly) paying for someone to hurt and kill them? Something doesn't align here. (Ok that wasn't exactly about the term 'sentient' but it's related. Perhaps instead of &quot;sentient&quot;, I mean &quot;creatures who we understand to be able to feel pain, experience suffering, and have a desire to not die.) ↩︎\n\nI'm tempted to say &quot;the world&quot; but realistically, my sphere of influence is the people that I interact with in my direct small community. Which is a great impact to make, in my opinion. Change starts small and local. ↩︎\n\nbecause seriously, even with 100% WFPB, things can be incredibly tasty and I wouldn't want them in any other form ↩︎\n\n(apapap) ↩︎\n\nyes there are several other aspects of this, to be expanded on elsewhere ↩︎",

		"content": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12300742/\n\n[!WARNING ] WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nI have mixed feelings about this movie.\nFirst: acting was great. Everything I'm about to say is very much supported by the acting.\nHere was my experience with this movie.\nI heard about the movie a couple months ago, and vaguely knew it was about someone maybe being an alien. I re-read the synopsis before watching it, which gave me more of a feeling that the character probably wasn't an alien.\nWhile watching it, I went back and forth several times whether I believed she was an alien or not. For most of the movie, the most plausible scenario was that she was not an alien. However, I knew there was a chance that there would be a twist and she would actually be an alien. (How many times can I say the word alien?)\nThat's kind of my problem with this. It feels like I was involved in a game between the director/writers and myself, where I was trying to puzzle this out, and the writers were tricking me until the very end. They won, honestly, and I was somewhat stricken at the end, or maybe actually self-satisfied due to my doubt.\nBut again, it felt more like an interaction between my and the writers, with the actors as the vessels of that interaction. This... actually sounds very deep and probably is actually a reflection of the purpose of all art and such. However, I think I'm actually trying to comment here about my level of investment in the movie.\nMy understanding of the characters obviously changed after the big &quot;reveal&quot;. Suddenly, the crazy conspiracy theorist had actually been right about things. And the person we were empathizing with for most of the movie actually turned out to... go ahead and destroy all of humanity. (I do wish that last part was expanded on more. Why did the aliens need to kill everyone? I also have a problem with this because she displayed some empathy toward sidekick cousin guy right after his death (I think...), so how could she not care at all about wiping out civilization? Perhaps she lost all faith in humanity due to the events of this movie.)\nI felt that this would've been a fine movie if the &quot;twist&quot; hadn't occurred. If it had just been about a CEO who was kidnapped and then managed to escape via her own wit. It would've been a great movie.\nThe ending cheapened it a little to me. It went from action/heist/drama to sci-fi. It cheapened my earlier understanding. But I'm not necessarily saying this turned it into a bad film. Just different. More wacky than the whole rest of the movie seemed. I read some review of the movie that said it should have been weirder earlier on, and maybe that would've made this change less harsh.\nAll that being said -- I am generally here for the experience and ride that the makers have charted for me. And it was a fun experience. And I know this is a remake of a film, so I feel like I can't be upset about the plot being the plot. I guess I can just be criticizing both versions, but I don't feel I can do that without having also seen the original. And unfortunately I don't think I liked the experience enough to watch the original. Even if I like the idea of having a deeper experience with the material. Gotta choose what to put my time into.\nOverall. Good film. Fun. Thrilling at times. The twist ending was fun, but the execution of it with respect to the rest of the movie didn't sit totally right with me. But maybe that was the point.",

		"content": "#movie #japanese\n\nIMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345728/\n(Warning: Not much spoilers here I think but I don't guarantee that there are no spoilers.)\nIf I'm being facetious, I'd say that after my thoughts about the movie Chef (with Jon Favreau) that I mentioned in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a>, which I mentioned inspired me to want to watch Chef again, I accidentally watched this movie instead. Well, that's basically what happened, but it wasn't accidental.\nI was searching up Chef and took a glance a bit too far down the line, and saw Chef of South Polar with its 7/10 IMDB rating, which maybe doesn't sound like so notably high of a rating, but given that I stumbled upon it in happenstance and mingling with other incredibly random movies that had the word &quot;Chef&quot; in them, it impressed me enough to at least give the synopsis a read. My attention was snared. A movie about researchers in Antarctica with a focus on the chef that is with them. All this to say, I watched about 30 seconds of Jon Favreau's Chef, decided I didn't need to watch it again, watched just the &quot;1 Second Everyday&quot; clip on YouTube, and then settled in for The Chef of South Polar.\nAnd? It was a good movie. Great movie. I gave it 5/5 on Letterboxd. It was funny and relaxing and had beautiful cinematography, especially of the food[1]. Just an overall very chill and feel-good movie. It often made me think of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars triology - the characters in that had to go through training in Antarctica to ensure they were psychologically fit to survive on Mars (due to the similar isolation and desertedness that Antarctica and Mars would share). Certainly the characters in the movie had a range of &quot;well-adjustedness&quot; to their conditions (meaning, sometimes not so well-adjusted).\nThere was also emotion to the movie. There were a couple moments where I felt a wave of emotion (chills), albeit brief. Specifically, the food scene after the protag loses his daughter's tooth and then the others make a meal for him and he cries. The new-ramen scene was also quite cool and a tad bit of emotion too.\nThere were a lot of hilarious moments - these kind of stand out more as the essence of the movie (but are balanced by the brief but touching emotional parts).\nIt's not a particularly fast-paced movie and there's not much plot, so it's mostly about enjoying the vibes and seeing how food brings these people together and laughing along with the silly situations they find themselves in.\nOh yeah and also, it being in Japanese, I appreciated it as a little motivator/challenge for my Japanese learning endeavors. It was nice to see myself catch some phrases and vocab words. I was particularly pleased when I was able to read &quot;tanjoubi&quot; (it was in hiragana in the movie. sorry, I don't have Japanese keyboard stuff setup on my laptop right now. I usually do that stuff on mobile.) on the cookies the chef was making and realize it was a birthday party seconds before they expanded on that visually. I'm mostly in a slump regarding Japanese learning recently (I completed 11/12 Genki Volume 1 sections and haven't gone back to it in months) and I'm not saying this movie is at all getting me out of it but it's a good reminder of the fun of language learning and the perks of learning more.\n\nI'm vegan. Given that most of the food pictured was not vegan, this summons thoughts and questions I ask myself about how I &quot;should&quot; and &quot;do&quot; feel about appreciating the cinematography of non-vegan food. Frankly, it's a complicated stream of thoughts that I haven't fully developed in this moment, so I'll leave that as a discussion for another time. ↩︎",

		"content": "#podcast #entrepreneurship #digitalgarden\nWritten on: 2025-12-07\nWell hello there. This is my first ever attempt at an actual blog post / garden entry. Yesterday was the first day I learned of the concept of a Digital Garden, from a short bit of this video (Relevant part at about 26:45 but the whole video is worth watching), which directed me to this article for more context on Digital Gardens.\nThen, today, I was exploring more examples of the concept and read a couple relevant articles, including &quot;Pick Up What They Put Down, which itself linked to the podcast that I'm about to discuss. [1]\nWhat's this podcast?\n&quot;Bootstrapping an App to Millions Through Sheer Persistence with Cesar Kuriyama of 1 Second Everyday&quot;, published January 1, 2020.\nIt was a pretty good listen. It's about the founder of the app &quot;1 Second Everyday&quot;, which has you take a 1 second video of your life, or whatever you want, every day, and then, presumably whenever you'd like to, export it into a continuous video of all those clips combined. I've never used it before, but I've definitely seen some other people's videos that they've shared. They're fun.\n\n[!question]- Tangent on my use of PhotoChron (similar app)\n\nI have done something similar in the past with an outdated, possibly-no-longer-supported Android app called PhotoChron, which prompted me to take a picture just of my face everyday, so I could generate a cool timelapse of what I looked like (and what I was wearing, and what my background was) over time. I started in 2017 and mostly had been consistent (it's 2025 at the time I'm writing this) with taking daily pictures, with some lapses here and there.\nI'm in a larger awkward period right now where I haven't done this in (I'm ashamed to admit this to myself because I'm kind of annoyed at losing the continuity) several months (or more) because I haven't redownloaded the app since getting a new phone (part of the problem is that it's no longer supported on the latest version of Android, so there'd have to be some &quot;hacking&quot; around to get it to work -- honestly, I should just have been taking pictures in my normal photos app and putting them in an album or something, but then I lose the little oval in the middle of the screen that PhotoChron overlays over the viewfinder to show me where to put my face, and I lose the niceness of it saving the photos All Together in The Right Place and backing it up to the folder in Google Drive where I already have all the rest of the pictures.) -- All that being said, I'll get around to fixing this setup someday, because I think I do still value the result.\n\nWhat drew me to listen to the podcast was that the PUWTPD article mentioned that the app had been featured in the movie Chef [2], which came about because the app's creator tweeted to Jon Favreau about something unrelated to the app, and then Jon Favreau found and liked the app via his profile.\nThe actual key word, though, that made me want to listen was &quot;bootstrapping&quot;. I love this term. It kind of makes me feel warm inside, in a nice way. I'm not joking. And I am talking about it in its intended context in this podcast.\nBootstrapping is when you develop an app/website/service/project, probably with the goal of making some income from it, without going the &quot;traditional&quot; route of raising money via investors of venture capitalists or similar. Instead, you kind of just go and make the thing and find ways to monetize it and organically grow it. I'm not exactly an expert on this topic, but it's the kind of thing that I want to do in the future to make something out of a personal project. I'd definitely like to listen to more episodes of the Indie Hackers podcast in the future.\nI originally came across the term bootstrapping from a random video I stumbled upon (or maybe not so random) [3] of this guy giving a talk... It stuck with me, though I haven't exactly followed it -- not yet at least. I intend to. [4]\nSo anyway, this was an interesting listen.\nHighlights\nSome nice tidbits that stuck out\n\nA good callout to not be too secretive about your app idea. Probably no one is going to steal it, and even if they do, they probably won't have the same passion as you do. And there can be a lot of benefit in sharing your idea with others and having conversations about it and seeing what people might be interested in, etc.\n\nI really needed to hear this, because I have been working on an app idea (<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a>) for at least a year (progress and effort have been too slow for my liking) and pretty much across the board I've been not telling people about what I'm working on -- though, that's more because I was scared that one slightly negative comment (or someone pointing out my idea already exists) would cause me to lose motivation to continue working on it, and less about someone stealing my idea.\nRecently, though, I've started talking about the idea to some people (because honestly it was just taking too long for me to create an MVP that I had to backtrack on the secret-keeping, perhaps in part to see if it would motivate me to work on it more frequently (it kind of has worked)). But hearing this reinforced from the podcast will certainly encourage me to do this more.\n\nThere was an interesting comment around the 44 minute mark when they were talking about the tweet to Jon Favreau. The app founder said that there's probably some tweet that anyone could make right now which could change their whole life. You would just need to identify what that tweet would be.\n\nThis kind of thought gives me chills. I find I want to believe it's true. It might take a billion alternate universe scenarios to find what that one tweet would be, but there probably is one out there. (Caveat that it'd be easier to find a tweet that could destroy your life rather than generate tremendous positive change -- the former case makes me shudder, rather than positive chills, with a sort of call-of-the-void[5] type feeling.)\nThis gives me similar vibes to thinking about the butterfly effect. You can track one small action in the past to where you are now. The tweet thing is kind of like a future projection of this. Maybe the tweet sets off a chain of events (like attracting the attention of a movie director on your app).\n\nThere was a mention of the book The Art of Non-Conformity (don't remember the exact context in the podcast around it - something related to running your own business rather than working within a corporation I think). I checked and it was already on my to-read list. Seems like something I would like reading and would get something out of.\nTowards the end of the podcast, there was a discussion about future forms of social media, and what a &quot;better&quot; version of it would be. A platform that doesn't want you to just scroll infinitely so that you see more ads, or get more data collected about you. (This was in the context of the 1 Second Everyday app possibly having a form of feed / social media integrated in it in the future (and making it the &quot;better&quot; form). This podcast is a few years old, so maybe this is already a thing in the app.)\n\nAlways an interesting topic, but right now it made me think of the concept of Digital Gardening, since in a way, I've approached it from an alleyway of being frustrated with traditional social media not giving me the kind of platform that I've felt myself craving for a while where I can have more meaningful engagement, both letting me put content/thoughts/writing out there (god forbid me putting this post in an Instagram caption or story) and receiving feedback/commentary in response to what I've put out there (yes, I'd like to participate in the other side of PUWTPD, too), and also just having a place where I can put my stuff and feeling more secure in it lasting there forever, and not having to worry about limitations like video length or worrying about &quot;which account&quot; to post something on.\nMore directly related to what they were talking about on the podcast, though, is that the Digital Gardening concept is related to evading the &quot;algorithm&quot; and infinite-scrolling feeds. Blogging and longer form content in itself is an antidote to this. Engaging more deeply with specific content rather than flitting from one short video/image to the next. (The video I mentioned earlier talks about this and other related antidotes)\n\nAnother video mentioned in the podcast that I'd like to watch: &quot;Stefan Sagmeister: The power of time off&quot; (TED talk)\n\nThat's what was top on mind. I noted a couple things while listening to the podcast (I was on a walk in The Park) and I covered them all above.\n\n[!danger]- Epilogue\nOne final note, on my experience writing this right now (spent about 1hr 45 min btw)... I've had the idea of starting a more traditional blog here and there, but it always felt like a big scary task, so of course I never got to it. The concept of the Digital Garden helped me get the initiative to do it — mainly because of the emphasis that it's a living, growing thing.\nYou don't have to view an article as a one-and-done entity. I could have just written the first third of this page and been happy with it for now and still had it be public on the web and maybe send it to some people. I also don't have to worry about this being perfect and polished and super cohesive and meaningful... It's more of a scrapbook journaling vibe than a perfected portfolio.\nI also feel like I don't need to be self-conscious about what material is on here — meaning, my &quot;first post&quot; can be this arbitrary podcast episode that I listened to. There are seeds I need to plant in the garden that maybe normally would come first, like giving a brief summary of who I am, or expanding more on my ideas and purposes for this site. But I can plant those seeds another day.\nAnother core concept of the Digital Garden is it not meant to be a chronological list of posts like a traditional blog — a post I write a year ago can be just as valuable and as open to being edited as any more recent post. Just the idea of having a hierarchy of categories and tags as a way to navigate a site, rather than a time-sorted list of posts, drew me in as well.\nMaybe these things aren't so different from traditional blogs, but the concept just gave me the push I needed (and surely some circumstances of general life right now, or the type of energy I've had in the last few days).\n\nIdeally I shall make a separate post about my feelings and inspiration for the Digital Garden concept, but I wanted to mention a bit here since this is the first post and it kind of led me directly to this podcast. Also, I can mention that I am kind of following the advice from &quot;Pick Up What They Put Down&quot; in that I'm responding to a podcast that I just listened to (and kind of also responding to that article in a way). ↩︎\n\n(a movie I've watched probably twice but only once really in my recent memory i.e. in the last five years -- great movie, and I'm feeling inspired to watch it again because of the discussion on this podcast) ↩︎\n\n(TODO: Find this video and link it) ↩︎\n\nGiven what goes on in my mind and with projects that I pursue, I would be surprised if I'm not making a decisive effort (and hopefully succeeding) to generate passive income from a bootstrapped app/website in the next x years (no i'm not defining x for you) ↩︎\n\n&quot;The call of the void describes the sudden, unexplained desire to participate in dangerous or self-destructive behaviors&quot; (source ) It's scary sometimes how easy it might be to ruin your own life. ↩︎",

		"content": "#podcast #entrepreneurship\nEpisode #177 of the Indie Hackers Podcast: &quot;Mastering the Lifestyle-First Approach to Indie Hacking with Daniel Vassallo&quot; - published October 20, 2020\nOverview\nThis was a good listen. After listening to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a> and much enjoying it, I wanted to give another episode a try. I actually asked Chat GPT for the best episodes of the podcast, liked the title of the first one it told me, and listened to it.\nThe person being interviewed was Daniel Vassallo, who had been working at Amazon for 6 years, I think as an engineer, earning a high salary ($500k+), and then quit his job to pursue his own things. The podcast was recorded about a year and a half after he quit. A theme was that he pursued several different areas, including developing a SAAS business, a couple other software products, and bringing him the most income were actually some e-books and video courses that he published.\nHe has an interesting success story with the ebook/courses because he created them in a small amount of time (weeks or a couple months) and made a lot of money off them -- over $100,000. The software pursuits were more slowly growing, with the SAAS pursuit being the strongest &quot;bet&quot;, but not something he was actively putting more effort into at the moment. (I wonder if this product has grown in the last five years.)\nBooks/course publishing\nI'm more interested generally in the creation of profitable software products, but it was kind of interesting to hear about the book/course pursuits, too. It makes me wonder what skills I have that I might be able to turn into technical writing or course material. At the same time, I wonder, even if I did have ideas for those things, is my time better off spent on making cool/profitable apps, which interests me more and feels more attuned to my skillset.\nI feel a bit silly talking about myself in that way, though, because I generally view myself as having a broad range of skillsets and having many different interests, which includes writing. But I don't normally think about writing in terms of creating something directly with the intention of making money off it. Writing something technical, like a guide on how to get better at some skill, feels more boring to me than writing fiction, or writing a guide on how to do something but having it free on the Internet. On that last point, though -- it's cool to have free skillsharing on the Internet, but at some point, it could make sense to develop whatever &quot;guide&quot; it is with more depth and have the &quot;premium&quot; version be the profit-driven book or course. There can be a balance.\nA recent example of this is the book &quot;Hypnosis Without Trance&quot; by James Tripp. Well, it already is a book in the first place, which in itself is in theory a profit-generating item, but there are a couple (not too many) lines in the book alluding to an online course/program for those interested in going more in depth. I didn't mind this promotion (/ the existence of the course) because I got a sense that the author was putting the core information into the book, so I wasn't missing anything, but I could imagine that someone might want to go further, or have hands-on instruction and feedback, thus making the course also valuable to them.\nNotes\nSome thoughts/highlights I noted about specific parts of the podcast discussion:\n\nYou can work on a project and publish it, and let it sit for a while, without actively working on it, and come back to it in the future.\n\nThis made me think of my work on <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a>. Sometimes I view it as: if I have even a little bit of success on it, it'll be The Thing that I am always working on. But by this advice, I don't necessarily have to adhere to that. I can get a core form of my app out, and just let people use it and see how it goes. Then I can pick it back up at some point and make improvements to it, or go harder on marketing it more. (But also probably smart to take initial traction and develop from there right away. But still, there can be a breaking point at some point.)\n\nThe host made a brief comment about the strategy of asking yourself what your future life/lifestyle looks\nA perk of having your own business / not having a corporate job is that you get to decide what you want to do every day. Which pursuit to focus on. Reminded me of the &quot;fall downhill&quot; advice from <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/videos/hank-green-tells-me-to-fall-downhill/\">Hank Green Tells Me To Fall Downhill</a> -- rather than someone telling you to do one specific thing and you having to follow it (or risk job security), you can make the decision on what to work on, and that might be the &quot;easier&quot; thing or the path of least resistance -- the thing you most want or feel like doing in the moment.\nWorking on multiple things at once can help smooth out the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. It might feel scary to work on one thing for six months and then there's a moment of seeing if you'll be rewarded for it, or if it doesn't pay off. Instead, if you work on a couple different things at once, there's less pressure on any one thing. It's a way of diversifying.\n\nI like this advice because it's in tune with how I operate. I generally already have different pursuits going on. At different scales too -- different coding projects (or ideas) as well as non-coding projects also (though usually not with a business focus).\nThere's a tradeoff here of losing focus on any one thing. It really depends on the person's working style. I think I accel at working on different things at once, and I feel the nervousness that Mr. Vassallo described, of wondering if the One Thing you're focusing on will work out. I don't really ever take that risk, though. Doing so is just not how I operate.\nI've tried sometimes to focus all my attention on one thing, and, at least for a recent time I did this, I would get stuck or lose motivation on the One Thing, procrastinate it and not make much progress, but still tell myself that this is the Only Thing I am allowing myself to work on, and nothing else, and so I don't make progress on anything. If instead I had allowed myself to switch between things more, I may have reduced the strain of needing to get the One Thing right (which paradoxically might raise motivation for it), and I can make progress on multiple things at once. Again, I seem to excel and feel most motivated and rewarded when I'm making incremental progress on a couple hobbies/projects at once.\n\nHost mentioned in the morning he likes to read some random(?) blog posts - the value of being exposed to new ideas/concepts/things that may not be what you normally consume / learn about. I like Kagi Small Web for this purpose. I recently added it to my RSS feed viewer app (I use Feedly on Android) - specifically, the RSS feed for &quot;appreciated&quot; posts.",

		"url":"/media-i-have-consumed/poetry/all-nearness-pauses-while-a-star-can-grow-e-e-cummings/",
		"content": "I selected and analyzed this poem for my high school English class. It's probably one of my favorite poems ever, if only because I spent some time puzzling over it, but also I love the imagery and the mysteries that it still contains for me (seriously, still don't understand &quot;not where not here but neither's blue most both). Also because I memorized it (just for fun - I wasn't required to memorize it).\nI try to test myself sometimes to see if I still have it memorized -- usually I don't, except for snippets. It's kind of fun to piece it back together after all these years.\nKind of arbitrary, but thinking about the poem evokes my childhood bedroom in my mind, probably because I had written out the poem on the whiteboard in my room while I was memorizing and analyzing it.\nSome of the lines have really stuck with me. &quot;more he gives than takes&quot; gives me chills -- thinking about what we gain with time rather than what we lose. Also get chills from the last few lines. Something plays in my mind when I read those last lines (well really throughout the whole poem), an image of a sunset, an image of many doors or worlds floating in midair (this must be a remnant of &quot;if a world ends... worlds begin to begin&quot; being the equivalent of &quot;one door closes, another one opens&quot;), and when I read the &quot;(see?)&quot; I literally gasp, a small, sharp intake of breath, or I visualize someone gasping as they see the evidence of what is being told to them, knowing it's true, seeing something new coming over the horizon.[1]\nI'm literally going to paste my analysis from that English class below. I do not claim to be 100% on the same page with what my past self wrote here. (some of it honestly seems like a bit of a stretch... But I can't blame my past self. It's a complicated and confusing poem!)\n(I feel weird adding this caveat, but my high school era was before AI-generated content, so yes this is analysis is 100% written by me (though, I think I remember getting help for a few things from the web, in particular the word swap thing (&quot;the and peaceful hills&quot;). I think everything else was just from my own contemplation.))\nMy English class analysis\n\n“all nearness pauses,while a star can grow”\n\n“A star can grow” represents sunset, when the sun (a “star”) appears to “grow” as it approaches the horizon\n“All nearness pauses” — the beauty and importance of the setting sun makes anyone watching it “pause” for a moment, staying still and remaining silent.\nThe comma in “pauses,while” emphasizes this pause, even though the comma is grammatically unnecessary. E. E. Cummings frequently uses punctuation to convey deeper meaning in this way.\n\n“all distance breathes a final dream of bells;”\n\nAs the sun sets, the sounds and events of the day are beginning to die down.\nThe start of the night begins with an exhale of breath, and the events of the day fade from immediate memory like a “dream”.\n\n“perfectly outlined against afterglow”\n\n“Afterglow”: light remaining in the sky after the sun has set\nAlso “afterglow”: good feelings remaining after a pleasurable or successful experience\n\nThe setting of the sun could signify the ending of a pleasurable event, or even one’s life. The “outline against afterglow” is the pleasant but fading memory of what is lost to the past.\n\n“are all amazing the and peaceful hills”\n\nCummings purposely rearranges the standard order of the words in the phrase “are all the amazing and peaceful hills”.\nHe does so to momentarily disorient the audience, emulating the loss of coherent words one experiences when observing a setting sun.\n\nThis feature is seen in several other of Cummings’ poems.\n\n“(not where not here but neither’s blue most both)”\n\nThis perhaps is in response to the question of “Where is the sun setting?”. In response, the narrator responds that where is not an appropriate question to ask, and that the sunset also did not occur here. This emphasizes that the sunrise occurs everywhere at once (for one hemisphere), not in just one particular place. Anywhere the sunset has just occurred, the sky will no longer be blue, because it is now night. However, the sky is only mostly devoid of blueness, because of the “afterglow” leaving behind some color.\nFiguratively, this could be answering the question, “Where did the events of my life occur?”. The answer is that they did not occur in any one place, but rather the impact of the events is so broad in history that their impact can be seen everywhere. Just as the sky is no longer blue after a sunset, the world is not the same as it was after these life events occurred, and the feeling or memory of those events is almost completely gone from one’s mind. However, some residual feelings of the events remain, so they are not yet completely lost.\n\n“and history immeasurably is / wealthier by a single sweet day’s death”\n\nThe sunset represents another day passing\nEvery day that passes, the events and experiences of that day are added permanently to history\n\n“as not imagined secrecies comprise / goldenly huge whole the uploating moon”\n\nWhen day ends, the moon remains in the sky to shine over the night.\nThe moon is a symbol of the day’s end and the transition of the next day, made up (“comprised”) of all the things that have not yet come to pass (“not imagined”). These future “secrecies” lie in wait for the coming day to see them to fruition, and meanwhile the moon holds on to them.\n\n“Time’s a strange fellow;/more he gives than takes/(and he takes all)”\n\nPersonifies the concept of time — the narrator reflects on Time as a peculiar creature who acts in an usually generous way.\nWhat does time give and take?\n\nTime takes youth, vitality, and life, and gives in return experience and wisdom\nTime takes days of the past, and gives to the future the histories that they contained\n\n“More he gives than takes” —\n\nThe experience and wisdom gained over time are more valuable than the lost youth — losing youth is worth it for what is gained\n“More he gives than takes/(and he takes all)” — paradox: implies that Time gives more than “all”. Stresses the great extent to which Time gives.\n\n“Nor any marvel finds/quite disappearance but some keener makes/losing,gaining”\n\n“Marvel”: a wonderful or astonishing person or thing\nTo this type of person, the days/time/youth that are lost do not “quite” feel like they have disappeared. Instead, they are able to turn losses into gains.\nLooking back at the lost days of one’s life should be fulfilling, even if those things can never again be experienced.\nThe narrator implies that the audience should also view their losses in this way\n\n“—love! if a world ends/more than all worlds begin to(see?)begin\n\n[if a world ends, more than all, worlds begin to begin]\n\nA closing door means that more doors begin to open, and new opportunities may arise\nThe day ending means that more days with new opportunities/experiences will follow\nCould also signify the end of one’s life, and the entrance to the afterlife. “See?” may be the narrator gesturing to the audience as they die and enter the afterlife.\n\nThe object in question is a “world” — this magnifies the sensation of loss and gain, on the planetary level\n\nOverall meaning of the poem\n\nPresents an optimistic view of loss, whether it be the loss of a good experience, or the loss of one’s life.\nWhat is lost is also a gain whether in memory or experience, and the fact of loss means that new things (such as the afterlife) can be experienced\n\nalso kind of evokes Eliza's gasp at the end of Hamilton. (I wonder if that Hamilton association is remnant of my interest in it during high school and so it became imbued with this poem, or if it's just because of the connection to the gasp that I'm thinking about now.) ↩︎",

		"content": "Video title: &quot;Don't Follow Your Dreams, Follow Your Tools&quot;\nChannel: Hank Green\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Rqf-vxBM8\nRelevant part of the video:\n&quot;When they're like, 'how do you decide what to do?' -- 'I fall downhill,' is what I say. I am not swimming upstream, very rarely. I might be swimming upstream in terms of the broader culture, but in terms of my skillset and my toolkit and my values, I am doing the easy thing at any given moment. Because I only have so much energy. And there are times when I'm doing the hard thing. But it's only ever because I am obliged too, like I have to become of some obligation that I have that I would feel like a true monster to ignore.... The idea isn't a good idea if it's gonna require a tremendous amount of discipline from me. Because I know that I don't have that discipline.&quot;\nMy thoughts\nI kinda agree/vibe with this and kind of don't.\nThe idea of &quot;falling downhill&quot; feels extremely relevant to me. I have a lot of interests and hobbies and pursuits, and I love the feeling when working on one of them is an easy thing to do, not requiring much effort because I am really into it and can easily reach a flow state. I've felt this way recently with writing (like, blog writing, i.e. Here) and piano (either practicing easy sheet music, or doing simple improvisation). Blogging/writing Here feels quite productive in the scheme of my pursuits, and I'm kind of surprising myself at how easy it feels.\nOn the other hand, I have pursuits that I feel are high importance to me that aren't as easy and that do require more discipline. However I disagree with Mister Green here because I view myself as obligated to pursue these areas, even if I wouldn't go as far as saying I'd feel like a &quot;monster&quot; to ignore them.\nThat being said, I do feel some resonance with the &quot;monster&quot; thing. My <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a> is not the easiest thing for me to work on[1] but I tell myself it's really important for me to work on because I feel like it can have a high impact on myself and potentially others if I (hopefully) publish it some day. I would kind of feel terrible (/monster) about myself, to myself, if I didn't give this a fair shot. However, it does feel uphill at times because of the energy required to work on it. But I do have the toolkit. So maybe it's just a circumstantial thing that makes this a hard project for me (where the circumstances are, code-fatigue from dayjob, and not making the right time/space/energy for this pursuit, and (perhaps often rightfully) spending energy on other aspects of life).\nBut still, I have other areas of pursuit that aren't &quot;easy&quot; to me but that I would love to get around to working on. Maybe this wording reveals something though -- &quot;get around to&quot;. Not necessarily working on them right now, instantaneously. Mister Green implies that at any given moment, he falls downhill. But perhaps something that is uphill right now could later be downhill in the future. So, I wait for the right time to work on this other pursuit, because in the future it may become easier. On the one hand, this could be a rationalization that gives way to procrastination (which is why the &quot;monster&quot; thing is important -- there are exceptions where I can enforce that discipline). But on the other hand, this mindset respects my energy and removes possibly unnecessary strain in life (and in hobbies that are usually supposed to be for fun and/or relaxation and etc).\nStill, though, I'm a strong believer in &quot;embrace discomfort&quot;. Always doing the easiest thing doesn't feel like it aligns with this.\nA couple other thoughts\n\nI feel there's some relation to: &quot;Do [x] if it aligns with your values&quot; ===&gt; &quot;Do the easiest thing, unless doing the harder thing aligns with your values&quot;. In choosing what to do with my time, I can do the easiest thing, but if there is a harder thing that is in alignment with my values / where I want to go in terms of fulfillment and self-actualization, then I should push myself to do that.\nWhen I say &quot;easiest thing&quot;, well, the truly easiest thing for me is usually watching tv or a movie or videos. What I'm really talking about here is Pursuits/hobbies. Taken literally, those are not zero energy. But if I'm in the headspace for working on a Pursuit, then there are some that are easier/lower-effort than others.\nI have a lot of hobbies/interests/pursuits, so I feel lucky in that even if at any given moment, certain of those pursuits feel easier or harder than others, I can focus on those easiest ones, and trust that in the future, the other ones may be the easier/downhill-facing ones. Trusting that I will get to them eventually. I sometimes also view this idea of getting back to something in the future as an &quot;envelope&quot; that my past self has sealed an idea/motivation in, to be opened by my future self at some point. This also resonates with Barbara Sher's concept of &quot;Cyclic scanners&quot; which for a while I've identified as being closely aligned to my pattern of cycling through interests -- whatever is in cycle right now may be what feels the &quot;easiest&quot; at the moment, and, per Sher's theory, once I've satisfied myself in that area in the short term, something else may catch my attention and become the &quot;easier&quot; thing (but also maybe it's the harder thing that catches my interest and I decide to devote the discipline to focus on it for that period of time).\n\n(though, that's partly because my coding energy gets sucked up by my day job -- counterargument to this is that I sometimes have other small coding ideas that are super fun and super easy, like my <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/mini-projects/restaurant-ai-vr-simulation/\">Restaurant AI VR Simulation</a> mini-project (though, I worked on this during a holiday from work)) ↩︎",

A tool that might help me catch myself before revealing too much.\nIs this a perfect solution? No.\nAm I overthinking this? Maybe.\nBut just like my footnote in my <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a> post (&quot;It's scary sometimes how easy it might be to ruin your own life&quot;), I feel that exposing some little piece of information about yourself in public could cause some mess for you. At best? Someone being creepy and sending you weird messages. At worst? Someone identifying a routine that you have and stalking you in real life. Or just hacking you via a spearphishing email that contains a link or download you mindlessly click.\nSo what's my little solution for this? An Obsidian plugin that will audit the current note I've written and tell me if I'm revealing too much information in the post. (Obsidian is the text editor I use to write these blog posts, and I use the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin for help building+publishing to this site.)\nHow it works\nThis is the workflow:\n\nInstall the plugin (see instructions on the Github repo, linked below) and set your OpenAI API key in the plugin settings. You can also modify the system prompt that tells the AI how to interpret your note and what the output should look like.\nYou write a note in Obsidian.\nOpen the command palette (ctrl/cmd + P) and run &quot;Privacy Audit&quot;.\nThe request will be processed by the OpenAI API and the result will be opened in a side panel.\n\nMore details\nI used ChatGPT to help me code this up. It didn't take long to set it up locally and test it out in Obsidian.\nThe plugin uses the OpenAI API to ask GPT to review the note and make any suggestions.\nI've published the code to my Github here and I've made a Pull Request on the Obsidian repo to get this added to the community plugin list so that anyone can access it. A fun little open-source contribution that I hope someone might find helpful! I'm pretty new to the Obsidian and Digital Gardening scene, so I hope the universe will forgive me if something like this already exists (I swear, I don't mean to flood the plugin list with slop).\nExamples\nThe command:\n\nThe plugin catches my reveal of a routine:\n\nThe plugin catches my reveal of corporate information:\n\nNo issues with this one! It gives some extraneous suggestions about my clearly engaging content:\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nAdd a command to run an audit for every file in the vault individually and get a summary of suggested fixes for each\nAdd a command to do a comprehensive audit across the whole vault, in case little bits of information in each file add up to a bigger picture (violating your privacy) which wouldn't be revealed within just one file. (This may be complicated since all the files won't fit in one GPT context window. There'd have to be some processing.)\nAdd a similar audit to the Github pipeline that actually gets triggered when I publish a note, so I don't have to remember to manually run the audit within Obsidian. If there is a critical warning, maybe fail the job, or maybe just alert me somehow.\n\nConcluding words\nI have a feeling I might think of other AI-related Obsidian plugins in the future.\n\nA retrospect from two days later\n(2025-12-10) Retrospectively, what I mostly actually developed here was a GPT wrapper for a single-prompt analysis of the current note. The only thing making it a &quot;security audit&quot; plugin is the system prompt, which is modifiable in the plugin settings. So, anyone could actually change the system prompt for themselves and use it for something different. (This is a good/cool thing.)\nMaybe I should instead have branded it as a generic GPT overlay. But I do also value the privacy focus because I feel like it's good to get people to think about it and give them a ready-made tool to do the privacy check up. So maybe I should make a separate plugin that has more emphasis on being a free-form AI tool.\nBut, without researching this at all, I'd guess that something like that already exists. GPT has been a thing for a while, and I'm sure that someone made a plugin to integrate a full chat into Obsidian. Fine, I'll check. Found this reddit post with some suggested plugins for this. I'm not discounting my own plugin, but maybe I don't need to expand it like I'm saying. At the same time, what I'm really suggesting here is a way for a user to set up any amount of custom commands which will execute one GPT system prompt on the active note. I could see this being a novel plugin idea.\n\n2025-12-11\nAlso, I realize that there is some irony/concern with passing the potentially sensitive note content to AI to scan for said potentially sensitive content. The tradeoff is, do I want to reveal my personal details to the Internet, or reveal them to an AI (read: the corporation running the AI)?\nAlso, my PR for the Obsidian plugin has kind of stalled, and I'm not feeling much motivation to push hard on it. Might be something I just let float around until I feel more strongly about it. It's a really teeny tiny mini project, not a big deal.",

		"content": "#digitalgarden\nThis is my &quot;digital garden&quot;. It's sort of a blog, sort of a personal wiki. It's a place for me to comment on media I've consumed, share about my interests and personal projects, and document my viewpoints or anything else I want to share with the world.\nWhat inspired this?\nI've had the idea of writing in a blog format for a while -- see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/meta/on-blogging/my-past-self-telling-me-to-start-a-blog/\">My Past Self Telling Me To Start a Blog</a>. Idea blossomed into reality after I watched a video[1] which introduced the idea of a digital garden. I then read more about the concept in this article.\nWhat directly appealed to me about the concept of a &quot;digital garden&quot; is that it's not a blog with an underlying purpose like promoting a product or gaining ad revenue. Instead, it's just a way for someone to express themselves to the world.\nEven though I've read handfuls of personal blogs before, I never connected the dots that it's something that just anyone could do. It seemed like you have to have a really strong and cohesive message or goal to put out there if you're going to be one of those people who starts a blog.\nBut it's a garden, not a farm. You plant some seeds and tend to the plants as they grow. Anyone can do it. Things don't have to be super polished. You can write a full-blown article about a topic you're interested in, or just a couple bullet points about an idea you recently had.\nWhat makes it a digital garden and not a blog?\nMaybe it's both?\nBut a digital garden has an emphasis on a few things:\n\nPosts don't have to be perfectly polished - they can be incomplete or in-progress at any given moment\nPosts aren't viewed as untouchable pieces of work - they can be changed and updated over time\nPosts aren't organized chronologically like in a typical blog. The preferred method of navigation is through categories or tags, or through backlinks from posts to posts.\n\nThis article goes into more detail about some of these points, and is worth a read if you're interested.\nWhat do I hope for a reader to get out of this site?\nPerhaps:\n\nBe entertained\nDiscover new resources, ideas, interests, or concepts\nUnderstand me better and have a glimpse into how my mind works\n\nWhat do I hope for myself to get out of this site?\nSee <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/meta/on-blogging/reasons-to-write-here/\">Reasons to Write (Here)</a>\nHow did I make this site?\nI use a text editor called Obsidian, which makes it easy to have a hierarchy of many interconnected notes, and publish to Github Pages.\nAlso see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/meta/obsidian-setup/\">Obsidian Setup</a>.\nWho in the world do I think is going to read this?\nPerhaps friends or family I share it with. But also over time, random people from the World Wide Web. At some point, I'd like to add it to the Kagi Small Web feed.\nEven if my audience is extremely tiny, I still feel motivated to write here. It's a long-term project representing myself.\n\n&quot;The Brainrot Apocalypse (a DIY survival guide)&quot; by Struthless. Relevant part at about 26:45 but the whole video is worth watching ↩︎",

I recently tried to re-install it on my phone by using an old APK (app installation file for Android) that I downloaded from the Google Play Dev Console, but installation failed because the architecture of the app was too out of date.
