		"content": "#movie #japanese\n\nIMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345728/\n(Warning: Not much spoilers here I think but I don't guarantee that there are no spoilers.)\nIf I'm being facetious, I'd say that after my thoughts about the movie Chef (with Jon Favreau) that I mentioned in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a>, which I mentioned inspired me to want to watch Chef again, I accidentally watched this movie instead. Well, that's basically what happened, but it wasn't accidental.\nI was searching up Chef and took a glance a bit too far down the line, and saw Chef of South Polar with its 7/10 IMDB rating, which maybe doesn't sound like so notably high of a rating, but given that I stumbled upon it in happenstance and mingling with other incredibly random movies that had the word &quot;Chef&quot; in them, it impressed me enough to at least give the synopsis a read. My attention was snared. A movie about researchers in Antarctica with a focus on the chef that is with them. All this to say, I watched about 30 seconds of Jon Favreau's Chef, decided I didn't need to watch it again, watched just the &quot;1 Second Everyday&quot; clip on YouTube, and then settled in for The Chef of South Polar.\nAnd? It was a good movie. Great movie. I gave it 5/5 on Letterboxd. It was funny and relaxing and had beautiful cinematography, especially of the food[1]. Just an overall very chill and feel-good movie. It often made me think of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars triology - the characters in that had to go through training in Antarctica to ensure they were psychologically fit to survive on Mars (due to the similar isolation and desertedness that Antarctica and Mars would share). Certainly the characters in the movie had a range of &quot;well-adjustedness&quot; to their conditions (meaning, sometimes not so well-adjusted).\nThere was also emotion to the movie. There were a couple moments where I felt a wave of emotion (chills), albeit brief. Specifically, the food scene after the protag loses his daughter's tooth and then the others make a meal for him and he cries. The new-ramen scene was also quite cool and a tad bit of emotion too.\nThere were a lot of hilarious moments - these kind of stand out more as the essence of the movie (but are balanced by the brief but touching emotional parts).\nIt's not a particularly fast-paced movie and there's not much plot, so it's mostly about enjoying the vibes and seeing how food brings these people together and laughing along with the silly situations they find themselves in.\nOh yeah and also, it being in Japanese, I appreciated it as a little motivator/challenge for my Japanese learning endeavors. It was nice to see myself catch some phrases and vocab words. I was particularly pleased when I was able to read &quot;tanjoubi&quot; (it was in hiragana in the movie. sorry, I don't have Japanese keyboard stuff setup on my laptop right now. I usually do that stuff on mobile.) on the cookies the chef was making and realize it was a birthday party seconds before they expanded on that visually. I'm mostly in a slump regarding Japanese learning recently (I completed 11/12 Genki Volume 1 sections and haven't gone back to it in months) and I'm not saying this movie is at all getting me out of it but it's a good reminder of the fun of language learning and the perks of learning more.\n\nI'm vegan. Given that most of the food pictured was not vegan, this summons thoughts and questions I ask myself about how I &quot;should&quot; and &quot;do&quot; feel about appreciating the cinematography of non-vegan food. Frankly, it's a complicated stream of thoughts that I haven't fully developed in this moment, so I'll leave that as a discussion for another time. ↩︎",

		"content": "#podcast #entrepreneurship #digitalgarden\nWritten on: 2025-12-07\nWell hello there. This is my first ever attempt at an actual blog post / garden entry. Yesterday was the first day I learned of the concept of a Digital Garden, from a short bit of this video (Relevant part at about 26:45 but the whole video is worth watching), which directed me to this article for more context on Digital Gardens.\nThen, today, I was exploring more examples of the concept and read a couple relevant articles, including &quot;Pick Up What They Put Down, which itself linked to the podcast that I'm about to discuss. [1]\nWhat's this podcast?\n&quot;Bootstrapping an App to Millions Through Sheer Persistence with Cesar Kuriyama of 1 Second Everyday&quot;, published January 1, 2020.\nIt was a pretty good listen. It's about the founder of the app &quot;1 Second Everyday&quot;, which has you take a 1 second video of your life, or whatever you want, every day, and then, presumably whenever you'd like to, export it into a continuous video of all those clips combined. I've never used it before, but I've definitely seen some other people's videos that they've shared. They're fun.\n\n[!question]- Tangent on my use of PhotoChron (similar app)\n\nI have done something similar in the past with an outdated, possibly-no-longer-supported Android app called PhotoChron, which prompted me to take a picture just of my face everyday, so I could generate a cool timelapse of what I looked like (and what I was wearing, and what my background was) over time. I started in 2017 and mostly had been consistent (it's 2025 at the time I'm writing this) with taking daily pictures, with some lapses here and there.\nI'm in a larger awkward period right now where I haven't done this in (I'm ashamed to admit this to myself because I'm kind of annoyed at losing the continuity) several months (or more) because I haven't redownloaded the app since getting a new phone (part of the problem is that it's no longer supported on the latest version of Android, so there'd have to be some &quot;hacking&quot; around to get it to work -- honestly, I should just have been taking pictures in my normal photos app and putting them in an album or something, but then I lose the little oval in the middle of the screen that PhotoChron overlays over the viewfinder to show me where to put my face, and I lose the niceness of it saving the photos All Together in The Right Place and backing it up to the folder in Google Drive where I already have all the rest of the pictures.) -- All that being said, I'll get around to fixing this setup someday, because I think I do still value the result.\n\nWhat drew me to listen to the podcast was that the PUWTPD article mentioned that the app had been featured in the movie Chef [2], which came about because the app's creator tweeted to Jon Favreau about something unrelated to the app, and then Jon Favreau found and liked the app via his profile.\nThe actual key word, though, that made me want to listen was &quot;bootstrapping&quot;. I love this term. It kind of makes me feel warm inside, in a nice way. I'm not joking. And I am talking about it in its intended context in this podcast.\nBootstrapping is when you develop an app/website/service/project, probably with the goal of making some income from it, without going the &quot;traditional&quot; route of raising money via investors of venture capitalists or similar. Instead, you kind of just go and make the thing and find ways to monetize it and organically grow it. I'm not exactly an expert on this topic, but it's the kind of thing that I want to do in the future to make something out of a personal project. I'd definitely like to listen to more episodes of the Indie Hackers podcast in the future.\nI originally came across the term bootstrapping from a random video I stumbled upon (or maybe not so random) [3] of this guy giving a talk... It stuck with me, though I haven't exactly followed it -- not yet at least. I intend to. [4]\nSo anyway, this was an interesting listen.\nHighlights\nSome nice tidbits that stuck out\n\nA good callout to not be too secretive about your app idea. Probably no one is going to steal it, and even if they do, they probably won't have the same passion as you do. And there can be a lot of benefit in sharing your idea with others and having conversations about it and seeing what people might be interested in, etc.\n\nI really needed to hear this, because I have been working on an app idea (<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a>) for at least a year (progress and effort have been too slow for my liking) and pretty much across the board I've been not telling people about what I'm working on -- though, that's more because I was scared that one slightly negative comment (or someone pointing out my idea already exists) would cause me to lose motivation to continue working on it, and less about someone stealing my idea.\nRecently, though, I've started talking about the idea to some people (because honestly it was just taking too long for me to create an MVP that I had to backtrack on the secret-keeping, perhaps in part to see if it would motivate me to work on it more frequently (it kind of has worked)). But hearing this reinforced from the podcast will certainly encourage me to do this more.\n\nThere was an interesting comment around the 44 minute mark when they were talking about the tweet to Jon Favreau. The app founder said that there's probably some tweet that anyone could make right now which could change their whole life. You would just need to identify what that tweet would be.\n\nThis kind of thought gives me chills. I find I want to believe it's true. It might take a billion alternate universe scenarios to find what that one tweet would be, but there probably is one out there. (Caveat that it'd be easier to find a tweet that could destroy your life rather than generate tremendous positive change -- the former case makes me shudder, rather than positive chills, with a sort of call-of-the-void[5] type feeling.)\nThis gives me similar vibes to thinking about the butterfly effect. You can track one small action in the past to where you are now. The tweet thing is kind of like a future projection of this. Maybe the tweet sets off a chain of events (like attracting the attention of a movie director on your app).\n\nThere was a mention of the book The Art of Non-Conformity (don't remember the exact context in the podcast around it - something related to running your own business rather than working within a corporation I think). I checked and it was already on my to-read list. Seems like something I would like reading and would get something out of.\nTowards the end of the podcast, there was a discussion about future forms of social media, and what a &quot;better&quot; version of it would be. A platform that doesn't want you to just scroll infinitely so that you see more ads, or get more data collected about you. (This was in the context of the 1 Second Everyday app possibly having a form of feed / social media integrated in it in the future (and making it the &quot;better&quot; form). This podcast is a few years old, so maybe this is already a thing in the app.)\n\nAlways an interesting topic, but right now it made me think of the concept of Digital Gardening, since in a way, I've approached it from an alleyway of being frustrated with traditional social media not giving me the kind of platform that I've felt myself craving for a while where I can have more meaningful engagement, both letting me put content/thoughts/writing out there (god forbid me putting this post in an Instagram caption or story) and receiving feedback/commentary in response to what I've put out there (yes, I'd like to participate in the other side of PUWTPD, too), and also just having a place where I can put my stuff and feeling more secure in it lasting there forever, and not having to worry about limitations like video length or worrying about &quot;which account&quot; to post something on.\nMore directly related to what they were talking about on the podcast, though, is that the Digital Gardening concept is related to evading the &quot;algorithm&quot; and infinite-scrolling feeds. Blogging and longer form content in itself is an antidote to this. Engaging more deeply with specific content rather than flitting from one short video/image to the next. (The video I mentioned earlier talks about this and other related antidotes)\n\nAnother video mentioned in the podcast that I'd like to watch: &quot;Stefan Sagmeister: The power of time off&quot; (TED talk)\n\nThat's what was top on mind. I noted a couple things while listening to the podcast (I was on a walk in The Park) and I covered them all above.\n\n[!danger]- Epilogue\nOne final note, on my experience writing this right now (spent about 1hr 45 min btw)... I've had the idea of starting a more traditional blog here and there, but it always felt like a big scary task, so of course I never got to it. The concept of the Digital Garden helped me get the initiative to do it — mainly because of the emphasis that it's a living, growing thing.\nYou don't have to view an article as a one-and-done entity. I could have just written the first third of this page and been happy with it for now and still had it be public on the web and maybe send it to some people. I also don't have to worry about this being perfect and polished and super cohesive and meaningful... It's more of a scrapbook journaling vibe than a perfected portfolio.\nI also feel like I don't need to be self-conscious about what material is on here — meaning, my &quot;first post&quot; can be this arbitrary podcast episode that I listened to. There are seeds I need to plant in the garden that maybe normally would come first, like giving a brief summary of who I am, or expanding more on my ideas and purposes for this site. But I can plant those seeds another day.\nAnother core concept of the Digital Garden is it not meant to be a chronological list of posts like a traditional blog — a post I write a year ago can be just as valuable and as open to being edited as any more recent post. Just the idea of having a hierarchy of categories and tags as a way to navigate a site, rather than a time-sorted list of posts, drew me in as well.\nMaybe these things aren't so different from traditional blogs, but the concept just gave me the push I needed (and surely some circumstances of general life right now, or the type of energy I've had in the last few days).\n\nIdeally I shall make a separate post about my feelings and inspiration for the Digital Garden concept, but I wanted to mention a bit here since this is the first post and it kind of led me directly to this podcast. Also, I can mention that I am kind of following the advice from &quot;Pick Up What They Put Down&quot; in that I'm responding to a podcast that I just listened to (and kind of also responding to that article in a way). ↩︎\n\n(a movie I've watched probably twice but only once really in my recent memory i.e. in the last five years -- great movie, and I'm feeling inspired to watch it again because of the discussion on this podcast) ↩︎\n\n(TODO: Find this video and link it) ↩︎\n\nGiven what goes on in my mind and with projects that I pursue, I would be surprised if I'm not making a decisive effort (and hopefully succeeding) to generate passive income from a bootstrapped app/website in the next x years (no i'm not defining x for you) ↩︎\n\n&quot;The call of the void describes the sudden, unexplained desire to participate in dangerous or self-destructive behaviors&quot; (source ) It's scary sometimes how easy it might be to ruin your own life. ↩︎",

		"content": "#podcast #entrepreneurship\nEpisode #177 of the Indie Hackers Podcast: &quot;Mastering the Lifestyle-First Approach to Indie Hacking with Daniel Vassallo&quot; - published October 20, 2020\nOverview\nThis was a good listen. After listening to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a> and much enjoying it, I wanted to give another episode a try. I actually asked Chat GPT for the best episodes of the podcast, liked the title of the first one it told me, and listened to it.\nThe person being interviewed was Daniel Vassallo, who had been working at Amazon for 6 years, I think as an engineer, earning a high salary ($500k+), and then quit his job to pursue his own things. The podcast was recorded about a year and a half after he quit. A theme was that he pursued several different areas, including developing a SAAS business, a couple other software products, and bringing him the most income were actually some e-books and video courses that he published.\nHe has an interesting success story with the ebook/courses because he created them in a small amount of time (weeks or a couple months) and made a lot of money off them -- over $100,000. The software pursuits were more slowly growing, with the SAAS pursuit being the strongest &quot;bet&quot;, but not something he was actively putting more effort into at the moment. (I wonder if this product has grown in the last five years.)\nBooks/course publishing\nI'm more interested generally in the creation of profitable software products, but it was kind of interesting to hear about the book/course pursuits, too. It makes me wonder what skills I have that I might be able to turn into technical writing or course material. At the same time, I wonder, even if I did have ideas for those things, is my time better off spent on making cool/profitable apps, which interests me more and feels more attuned to my skillset.\nI feel a bit silly talking about myself in that way, though, because I generally view myself as having a broad range of skillsets and having many different interests, which includes writing. But I don't normally think about writing in terms of creating something directly with the intention of making money off it. Writing something technical, like a guide on how to get better at some skill, feels more boring to me than writing fiction, or writing a guide on how to do something but having it free on the Internet. On that last point, though -- it's cool to have free skillsharing on the Internet, but at some point, it could make sense to develop whatever &quot;guide&quot; it is with more depth and have the &quot;premium&quot; version be the profit-driven book or course. There can be a balance.\nA recent example of this is the book &quot;Hypnosis Without Trance&quot; by James Tripp. Well, it already is a book in the first place, which in itself is in theory a profit-generating item, but there are a couple (not too many) lines in the book alluding to an online course/program for those interested in going more in depth. I didn't mind this promotion (/ the existence of the course) because I got a sense that the author was putting the core information into the book, so I wasn't missing anything, but I could imagine that someone might want to go further, or have hands-on instruction and feedback, thus making the course also valuable to them.\nNotes\nSome thoughts/highlights I noted about specific parts of the podcast discussion:\n\nYou can work on a project and publish it, and let it sit for a while, without actively working on it, and come back to it in the future.\n\nThis made me think of my work on <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a>. Sometimes I view it as: if I have even a little bit of success on it, it'll be The Thing that I am always working on. But by this advice, I don't necessarily have to adhere to that. I can get a core form of my app out, and just let people use it and see how it goes. Then I can pick it back up at some point and make improvements to it, or go harder on marketing it more. (But also probably smart to take initial traction and develop from there right away. But still, there can be a breaking point at some point.)\n\nThe host made a brief comment about the strategy of asking yourself what your future life/lifestyle looks\nA perk of having your own business / not having a corporate job is that you get to decide what you want to do every day. Which pursuit to focus on. Reminded me of the &quot;fall downhill&quot; advice from <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/videos/hank-green-tells-me-to-fall-downhill/\">Hank Green Tells Me To Fall Downhill</a> -- rather than someone telling you to do one specific thing and you having to follow it (or risk job security), you can make the decision on what to work on, and that might be the &quot;easier&quot; thing or the path of least resistance -- the thing you most want or feel like doing in the moment.\nWorking on multiple things at once can help smooth out the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. It might feel scary to work on one thing for six months and then there's a moment of seeing if you'll be rewarded for it, or if it doesn't pay off. Instead, if you work on a couple different things at once, there's less pressure on any one thing. It's a way of diversifying.\n\nI like this advice because it's in tune with how I operate. I generally already have different pursuits going on. At different scales too -- different coding projects (or ideas) as well as non-coding projects also (though usually not with a business focus).\nThere's a tradeoff here of losing focus on any one thing. It really depends on the person's working style. I think I accel at working on different things at once, and I feel the nervousness that Mr. Vassallo described, of wondering if the One Thing you're focusing on will work out. I don't really ever take that risk, though. Doing so is just not how I operate.\nI've tried sometimes to focus all my attention on one thing, and, at least for a recent time I did this, I would get stuck or lose motivation on the One Thing, procrastinate it and not make much progress, but still tell myself that this is the Only Thing I am allowing myself to work on, and nothing else, and so I don't make progress on anything. If instead I had allowed myself to switch between things more, I may have reduced the strain of needing to get the One Thing right (which paradoxically might raise motivation for it), and I can make progress on multiple things at once. Again, I seem to excel and feel most motivated and rewarded when I'm making incremental progress on a couple hobbies/projects at once.\n\nHost mentioned in the morning he likes to read some random(?) blog posts - the value of being exposed to new ideas/concepts/things that may not be what you normally consume / learn about. I like Kagi Small Web for this purpose. I recently added it to my RSS feed viewer app (I use Feedly on Android) - specifically, the RSS feed for &quot;appreciated&quot; posts.",

		"content": "Video title: &quot;Don't Follow Your Dreams, Follow Your Tools&quot;\nChannel: Hank Green\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Rqf-vxBM8\nRelevant part of the video:\n&quot;When they're like, 'how do you decide what to do?' -- 'I fall downhill,' is what I say. I am not swimming upstream, very rarely. I might be swimming upstream in terms of the broader culture, but in terms of my skillset and my toolkit and my values, I am doing the easy thing at any given moment. Because I only have so much energy. And there are times when I'm doing the hard thing. But it's only ever because I am obliged too, like I have to become of some obligation that I have that I would feel like a true monster to ignore.... The idea isn't a good idea if it's gonna require a tremendous amount of discipline from me. Because I know that I don't have that discipline.&quot;\nMy thoughts\nI kinda agree/vibe with this and kind of don't.\nThe idea of &quot;falling downhill&quot; feels extremely relevant to me. I have a lot of interests and hobbies and pursuits, and I love the feeling when working on one of them is an easy thing to do, not requiring much effort because I am really into it and can easily reach a flow state. I've felt this way recently with writing (like, blog writing, i.e. Here) and piano (either practicing easy sheet music, or doing simple improvisation). Blogging/writing Here feels quite productive in the scheme of my pursuits, and I'm kind of surprising myself at how easy it feels.\nOn the other hand, I have pursuits that I feel are high importance to me that aren't as easy and that do require more discipline. However I disagree with Mister Green here because I view myself as obligated to pursue these areas, even if I wouldn't go as far as saying I'd feel like a &quot;monster&quot; to ignore them.\nThat being said, I do feel some resonance with the &quot;monster&quot; thing. My <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a> is not the easiest thing for me to work on[1] but I tell myself it's really important for me to work on because I feel like it can have a high impact on myself and potentially others if I (hopefully) publish it some day. I would kind of feel terrible (/monster) about myself, to myself, if I didn't give this a fair shot. However, it does feel uphill at times because of the energy required to work on it. But I do have the toolkit. So maybe it's just a circumstantial thing that makes this a hard project for me (where the circumstances are, code-fatigue from dayjob, and not making the right time/space/energy for this pursuit, and (perhaps often rightfully) spending energy on other aspects of life).\nBut still, I have other areas of pursuit that aren't &quot;easy&quot; to me but that I would love to get around to working on. Maybe this wording reveals something though -- &quot;get around to&quot;. Not necessarily working on them right now, instantaneously. Mister Green implies that at any given moment, he falls downhill. But perhaps something that is uphill right now could later be downhill in the future. So, I wait for the right time to work on this other pursuit, because in the future it may become easier. On the one hand, this could be a rationalization that gives way to procrastination (which is why the &quot;monster&quot; thing is important -- there are exceptions where I can enforce that discipline). But on the other hand, this mindset respects my energy and removes possibly unnecessary strain in life (and in hobbies that are usually supposed to be for fun and/or relaxation and etc).\nStill, though, I'm a strong believer in &quot;embrace discomfort&quot;. Always doing the easiest thing doesn't feel like it aligns with this.\nA couple other thoughts\n\nI feel there's some relation to: &quot;Do [x] if it aligns with your values&quot; ===&gt; &quot;Do the easiest thing, unless doing the harder thing aligns with your values&quot;. In choosing what to do with my time, I can do the easiest thing, but if there is a harder thing that is in alignment with my values / where I want to go in terms of fulfillment and self-actualization, then I should push myself to do that.\nWhen I say &quot;easiest thing&quot;, well, the truly easiest thing for me is usually watching tv or a movie or videos. What I'm really talking about here is Pursuits/hobbies. Taken literally, those are not zero energy. But if I'm in the headspace for working on a Pursuit, then there are some that are easier/lower-effort than others.\nI have a lot of hobbies/interests/pursuits, so I feel lucky in that even if at any given moment, certain of those pursuits feel easier or harder than others, I can focus on those easiest ones, and trust that in the future, the other ones may be the easier/downhill-facing ones. Trusting that I will get to them eventually. I sometimes also view this idea of getting back to something in the future as an &quot;envelope&quot; that my past self has sealed an idea/motivation in, to be opened by my future self at some point. This also resonates with Barbara Sher's concept of &quot;Cyclic scanners&quot; which for a while I've identified as being closely aligned to my pattern of cycling through interests -- whatever is in cycle right now may be what feels the &quot;easiest&quot; at the moment, and, per Sher's theory, once I've satisfied myself in that area in the short term, something else may catch my attention and become the &quot;easier&quot; thing (but also maybe it's the harder thing that catches my interest and I decide to devote the discipline to focus on it for that period of time).\n\n(though, that's partly because my coding energy gets sucked up by my day job -- counterargument to this is that I sometimes have other small coding ideas that are super fun and super easy, like my <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/mini-projects/restaurant-ai-vr-simulation/\">Restaurant AI VR Simulation</a> mini-project (though, I worked on this during a holiday from work)) ↩︎",

The solution was to manually go into the site's Github repo and edit src/site/feed.njk so that all of the &lt;link&gt; tags have a closing tag with five backslashes instead of four (yes this is a weird error/workaround).\nSetting custom domain name\nI added garden.briancher.in as my domain in Github Pages settings, but it got cleared any time I published a note from Obsidian. Thankfully I quickly found a note in the repo's readme which said I needed to add the domain also to .github/workflows/build.yml.",

		"content": "#digitalgarden #obsidian #cybersecurity #privacy #project #coding #miniproject\nAnytime I make a new public appearance (like making a new social media account, or this blog) I ask myself: am I revealing too much about myself to the Internet? I have some background in cybersecurity (meaning: a handful of classes at university), so I have some mental framework that lets me contemplate the consequences of having information about myself online.\nThere's a little voice in my head saying not to publish an article with this title (&quot;please don't spearphish me&quot;) because it might act as reverse psychology and give someone the idea to do it just because I mentioned it. Please don't be that person.\nAnyway, my point here is that I'm building some level of a safeguard for myself. A tool that might help me catch myself before revealing too much.\nIs this a perfect solution? No.\nAm I overthinking this? Maybe.\nBut just like my footnote in my <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/media-i-have-consumed/podcasts/1-second-everyday-indie-hackers-podcast/\">1 Second Everyday - Indie Hackers Podcast</a> post (&quot;It's scary sometimes how easy it might be to ruin your own life&quot;), I feel that exposing some little piece of information about yourself in public could cause some mess for you. At best? Someone being creepy and sending you weird messages. At worst? Someone identifying a routine that you have and stalking you in real life. Or just hacking you via a spearphishing email that contains a link or download you mindlessly click.\nSo what's my little solution for this? An Obsidian plugin that will audit the current note I've written and tell me if I'm revealing too much information in the post. (Obsidian is the text editor I use to write these blog posts, and I use the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin for help building+publishing to this site.)\nHow it works\nThis is the workflow:\n\nInstall the plugin (see instructions on the Github repo, linked below) and set your OpenAI API key in the plugin settings. You can also modify the system prompt that tells the AI how to interpret your note and what the output should look like.\nYou write a note in Obsidian.\nOpen the command palette (ctrl/cmd + P) and run &quot;Privacy Audit&quot;.\nThe request will be processed by the OpenAI API and the result will be opened in a side panel.\n\nMore details\nI used ChatGPT to help me code this up. It didn't take long to set it up locally and test it out in Obsidian.\nThe plugin uses the OpenAI API to ask GPT to review the note and make any suggestions.\nI've published the code to my Github here and I've made a Pull Request on the Obsidian repo to get this added to the community plugin list so that anyone can access it. A fun little open-source contribution that I hope someone might find helpful! I'm pretty new to the Obsidian and Digital Gardening scene, so I hope the universe will forgive me if something like this already exists (I swear, I don't mean to flood the plugin list with slop).\nExamples\nThe command:\n\nThe plugin catches my reveal of a routine:\n\nThe plugin catches my reveal of corporate information:\n\nNo issues with this one! It gives some extraneous suggestions about my clearly engaging content:\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nAdd a command to run an audit for every file in the vault individually and get a summary of suggested fixes for each\nAdd a command to do a comprehensive audit across the whole vault, in case little bits of information in each file add up to a bigger picture (violating your privacy) which wouldn't be revealed within just one file. (This may be complicated since all the files won't fit in one GPT context window. There'd have to be some processing.)\nAdd a similar audit to the Github pipeline that actually gets triggered when I publish a note, so I don't have to remember to manually run the audit within Obsidian. If there is a critical warning, maybe fail the job, or maybe just alert me somehow.\n\nConcluding words\nI have a feeling I might think of other AI-related Obsidian plugins in the future.\n\nA retrospect from two days later\n(2025-12-10) Retrospectively, what I mostly actually developed here was a GPT wrapper for a single-prompt analysis of the current note. The only thing making it a &quot;security audit&quot; plugin is the system prompt, which is modifiable in the plugin settings. So, anyone could actually change the system prompt for themselves and use it for something different. (This is a good/cool thing.)\nMaybe I should instead have branded it as a generic GPT overlay. But I do also value the privacy focus because I feel like it's good to get people to think about it and give them a ready-made tool to do the privacy check up. So maybe I should make a separate plugin that has more emphasis on being a free-form AI tool.\nBut, without researching this at all, I'd guess that something like that already exists. GPT has been a thing for a while, and I'm sure that someone made a plugin to integrate a full chat into Obsidian. Fine, I'll check. Found this reddit post with some suggested plugins for this. I'm not discounting my own plugin, but maybe I don't need to expand it like I'm saying. At the same time, what I'm really suggesting here is a way for a user to set up any amount of custom commands which will execute one GPT system prompt on the active note. I could see this being a novel plugin idea.\n\n2025-12-11\nAlso, I realize that there is some irony/concern with passing the potentially sensitive note content to AI to scan for said potentially sensitive content. The tradeoff is, do I want to reveal my personal details to the Internet, or reveal them to an AI (read: the corporation running the AI)?\nAlso, my PR for the Obsidian plugin has kind of stalled, and I'm not feeling much motivation to push hard on it. Might be something I just let float around until I feel more strongly about it. It's a really teeny tiny mini project, not a big deal.",

You control a bee's movement to the left and right as it moves forward toward the horizon, collecting flowers and avoiding birds.\nThe graphics were very simplistic (I vaguely wanted to make them better in the future but never went back to it).\n\nI published it to the Google Play Store (under a pseudonym because I was very resistant to publishing things under my real name back then) but eventually it got taken down because I needed to update things to comply with Google's new developer rules (possibly could've been something as easy as adding a privacy policy to my app, but I just never bothered to expend the energy to do whatever it needed me to do).\nBut also recently, I've been wanting to show people a demo of the game. I recently tried to re-install it on my phone by using an old APK (app installation file for Android) that I downloaded from the Google Play Dev Console, but installation failed because the architecture of the app was too out of date. There is, however, a usable version of the game that can be accessed via <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/really-old-projects/brianiscool-tk/\">brianiscool.tk</a>, so in theory I can show people from that, but I'd prefer the app experience.\nSo...\n\nRun it locally and build it to Android, test it\nTry re-publishing it to the Play Store???\nCould also think about what improvements I could make (though tbh don't feel it's the place for me to invest my energy in anytime soon, especially with projects like <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/projects/software/specific-main-app-pursuit-i-m-currently-working-on/\">Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On</a> on top of my mind)",
