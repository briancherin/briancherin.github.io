Well hello there. This is my first ever attempt at an actual blog post / garden entry. Yesterday was the first day I learned of the concept of a Digital Garden, from a short bit of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fj-OJ6RcNQ) (Relevant part at about 26:45 but the whole video is worth watching), which directed me to [this article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) for more context on Digital Gardens. 

Then, today, I was exploring more examples of the concept and read a couple relevant articles, including ["Pick Up What They Put Down](https://web.archive.org/web/20250327004843/https://www.swyx.io/puwtpd), which itself linked to the podcast that I'm about to discuss. Ideally I shall make a separate post about my feelings and inspiration for the Digital Garden concept, but I wanted to mention a bit here since this is the first post and it kind of led me directly to this podcast. Also, I can mention that I am kind of following the advice from "Pick Up What They Put Down" in that I'm responding to a podcast that I just listened to (and kind of also responding to that article in a way). 

### What's this podcast?

["Bootstrapping an App to Millions Through Sheer Persistence with Cesar Kuriyama of 1 Second Everyday"](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/141-cesar-kuriyama-of-1-second-everyday), published January 1, 2020.

It was a pretty good listen. It's about the founder of the app "1 Second Everyday", which has you take a 1 second video of your life, or whatever you want, every day, and then, presumably whenever you'd like to, export it into a continuous video of all those clips combined. I've never used it before, but I've definitely seen some other people's videos that they've shared. They're fun. 

>[!tip]- Tangent on my use of PhotoChron (similar app)
I have done something similar in the past with an outdated, possibly-no-longer-supported Android app called [PhotoChron](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photochron&hl=en_US), which prompted me to take a picture just of my face everyday, so I could generate a cool timelapse of what I looked like (and what I was wearing, and what my background was) over time. I started in 2017 and mostly had been consistent (it's 2025 at the time I'm writing this) with taking daily pictures, with some lapses here and there. I'm in a larger awkward period right now where I haven't done this in (I'm ashamed to admit this to myself because I'm kind of annoyed at losing the continuity) several months (or more) because I haven't redownloaded the app since getting a new phone (part of the problem is that it's no longer supported on the latest version of Android, so there'd have to be some "hacking" around to get it to work -- honestly, I should just have been taking pictures in my normal photos app and putting them in an album or something, but then I lose the little oval in the middle of the screen that PhotoChron overlays over the viewfinder to show me where to put my face, and I lose the niceness of it saving the photos All Together in The Right Place and backing it up to the folder in Google Drive where I already have all the rest of the pictures.) -- All that being said, I'll get around to fixing this setup someday.

What drew me to listen to the podcast was that the PUWTPD article mentioned that the app had been featured in the movie Chef ^[(a movie I've watched probably twice but only once really in my recent memory i.e. in the last five years -- great movie, and I'm feeling inspired to watch it again because of the discussion on this podcast)], which came about because the app's creator tweeted to Jon Favreau about something unrelated to the app, and then Jon Favreau found and liked the app via his profile. 

The actual key word, though, that made me want to listen was "bootstrapping". I love this term. I have a lot of feelings about it. I'm not joking. And I am talking about it in its intended context in this podcast.
