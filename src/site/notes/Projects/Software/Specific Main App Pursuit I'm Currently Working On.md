#project 

### Slowness
I started writing down ideas related to this project in July of 2024. It's taken me a really long time to make progress. There are several factors that have caused this.
- General life stuff - changing priorities, other pursuits capturing my interest (like piano and learning Japanese)
- Coding/focusing at work makes it difficult to want to code outside of work
- I got stuck on some infrastructure aspects that took me a while to figure out

Specifically on that last point (stalled infrastructure), now that I've gotten past those hurdles, development of my prototype (writing this as of January 2026) has been speeding along and I'm making a lot of progress. 

I've also decided to use AI to help me code - at this point, if it gets me to work on this project, I want to leverage AI because I just want to have my prototype ready. I've started using OpenAI's codex in my command line (previously I was just occasionally using ChatGPT and copy/pasting relevant code back and forth) and it's made things so much easier.
