- ["Make Tiny Games." by Juniper Dev (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtylfQq2JII)
	- Made me feel a brief moment of inspiration to code up small games - clones of existing ones with modifications, or just novel simple ones. Mostly made me think of [[Projects/Software/Game Development/Old projects/Bee Haven\|Bee Haven]], which is sort of a subway surfer clone I made during high school. I've recently been thinking of repolishing and republishing it to the Play Store.
