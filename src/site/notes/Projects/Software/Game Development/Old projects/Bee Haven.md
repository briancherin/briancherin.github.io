A game I made during a high school summer program I attended. It's an infinite scroller. You control a bee's movement to the left and right as it moves forward toward the horizon, collecting flowers and avoiding birds.

The graphics were very simplistic (I vaguely wanted to make them better in the future but never went back to it).

I published it to the Google Play Store (under a pseudonym because I was very resistant to publishing things under my real name back then) but eventually it got taken down because I needed to update things to comply with Google's new developer rules (possibly could've been something as easy as adding a privacy policy to my app, but I just never bothered to expend the energy to do this).

But also recently, I've been wanting to show people a demo of the game. I recently tried to re-install it on my phone by using an old APK (app installation file for Android) that I downloaded from the Google Play Dev Console, but installation failed because the architecture of the app was too out of date. There is, however, a usable version of the game that can be accessed via [[Projects/Software/Really Old Projects/brianiscool.tk\|brianiscool.tk]], so in theory I can show people from that, but I'd prefer the app experience.

So...
- [ ] Run it locally and build it to Android, test it
- [ ] Try re-publishing it to the Play Store???
- [ ] Could also think about what improvements I could make (though tbh don't feel it's the place for me to invest my energy in anytime soon, especially with projects like [[Projects/Software/Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On\|Specific Main App Pursuit I'm Currently Working On]] on top of my mind)
