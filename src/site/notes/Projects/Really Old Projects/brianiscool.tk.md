This website was one of the first coding projects I worked on, back in high school. My version of a portfolio but a bit silly.

I originally hosted it using a webhost called 000webhost (I don't think it exists anymore) and Freenom for a free domain name (probably free because it was for non-traditional domain endings, like ".tk" or ".cw"). Eventually I forgot to keep renewing the domain and probably the hosting broke at some point, but luckily I had the original source files saved locally (or maybe on Github actually) so I turned it into a Github Pages site which is mostly functional to what it was originally like.

Scavenger hunt / things to watch out for:
- Random color generator
- Farm animal game (weirdly fun but eventually not balanced)
- Bee Haven game (warning that this is not particularly mobile-friendly but it'll still work)
- Try not to fall into The Trap (the curse of 100 alert dialogs)
