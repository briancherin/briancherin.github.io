Things to do:
- [ ] Set my own favicon instead of the default
- [ ] add a commenting system
	- [x] (Done, 12/8/2025) Or at least an (optionally-anonymous) feedback/contact form in the mean time
- [ ] make it so the date published and date last updated appears on pages
- [ ] make a list of my hobbies/interests (and then eventually link pages/folders from them)
- [ ] be able to see page view count (analytics)
- [x] (Done, 12/8/2025) Fix /feed.xml so it can generate RSS feed. There's an issue with the html snippet on the homepage for the 'random note' button
- [ ] Post this site to Kagi Small Web
