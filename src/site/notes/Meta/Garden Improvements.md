#digitalgarden 

Things to do:
- [ ] Set my own favicon instead of the default
- [ ] add a commenting system
	- [x] (Done, 12/8/2025) Or at least an (optionally-anonymous) feedback/contact form in the mean time
- [x] make it so the date published and date last updated appears on pages
- [ ] make a list of my hobbies/interests (and then eventually link pages/folders from them)
- [ ] be able to see page view count (analytics) (possibly some good guidance [here](https://tjpalanca.com/2023/05/20/nerfing-google-analytics.html))
- [x] (Done, 12/8/2025) Fix /feed.xml so it can generate RSS feed. There's an issue with the html snippet on the homepage for the 'random note' button
- [ ] Post this site to Kagi Small Web
- [ ] Make a visualization to see frequency of posts over time 
- [ ] May want to eventually setup Obsidian to host images/other_assets on S3 instead of on Github. The Digital Garden plugin mentioned that the site may slow down if the assets pile up since you can't store that much on Github. I found this Obsidian [plugin](https://github.com/biubiubiu35/image-paste-to-cloud) which might be the solution for an auto-S3 upload of images.
