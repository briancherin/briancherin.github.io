Things to do:
- Set my own favicon instead of the default
- add a commenting system
	- Or at least an (optionally-anonymous) feedback/contact form in the mean time
- make it so the date published and date last updated appears on pages
- make a list of my hobbies/interests (and then eventually link pages/folders from them)
- be able to see page view count
