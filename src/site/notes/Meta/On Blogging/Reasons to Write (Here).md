- Doing any writing makes me a better writer by developing the skill
- Expressing my ideas and sharing them with people, which can lead to connection (with people), collaboration, insight
- Writing things out provides a means of developing ideas, possibly leading towards insights and connections (between ideas)


#### Inevitability
I'm feeling an inevitability in my writing here. As of writing this paragraph, it's been about three weeks since I've started writing here. It has felt so natural to write and to have things to write about, in this format and with having a public audience in mind. I've surprised myself - it's not often I begin a pursuit that feels this *[[Media I Have Consumed/Misc/Hank Green Tells Me To Fall Downhill\|easy]]*. It feels like I've been doing this forever but it's been such a short time. It doesn't feel like I will ever want to stop writing here, unless I at some point feel like I have privacy or safety concerns (which I try to be [[Meta/On Blogging/Please Don't Spearphish Me (Creating an Obsidian Plugin)\|mindful]] of when publishing my writing).
