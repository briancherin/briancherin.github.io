Digging in the archives of my Google Keep notes:


From May 5, 2018:

> [!NOTE] 
> Start a blog, because cool people have blogs. But don't do it for money or fame. Do it to write about things you like writing about, and if anyone reads it, that will be reward in itself.
> 
>   
> 
> Write about:
> 
> Unicycling 
> 
> Complaints about society or myself

(My past self was a little bit performative about the concept of "being cool", but it was mostly in a silly joking way and more about inspiring myself to do interesting things with my time.)


From June 8, 2018:

> [!NOTE] 
>When there's an interesting quote or passage or idea in a book you're reading, write about it (use those skills from all your English classes over the years) and maybe make a blog post about it! Who knows, maybe someone will be interested in your thoughts. But do pure thoughts. Okay, not \#thoughtstream thoughts, as this is approaching, (well this style would be fine for a blogpost, if not excellent for displaying my personality) but don't flourish the writing - make it true to yourself.


From June 3, 2018:

>[!NOTE]
**Things I could write about on a blog**
>- \<redacted\>
>-  \<redacted\> (eventually)
>- juggling, unicycling
>- programming
>- China/Japan
>- The physics of microwave doors
>- Hour of code
>- Book review
>- Product reviews! Once your blog starts growing, you can start places for free stuff (eg filament)
>- Electronics robot

(No, I'm not sure why physics of microwave doors is on this list.)
