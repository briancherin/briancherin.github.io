#digitalgarden 

This is my "digital garden". It's sort of a blog, sort of a personal wiki. It's a place for me to comment on media I've consumed, share about my interests and personal projects, and document my viewpoints or anything else I want to share with the world.

### What inspired this?
I've had the idea of writing in a blog format for a while -- see [[Meta/On Blogging/My Past Self Telling Me To Start a Blog\|My Past Self Telling Me To Start a Blog]]. Idea blossomed into reality after I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fj-OJ6RcNQ)^["The Brainrot Apocalypse (a DIY survival guide)" by Struthless. Relevant part at about 26:45 but the whole video is worth watching] which introduced the idea of a digital garden. I then read more about the concept in [this article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). 

What directly appealed to me about the concept of a "digital garden" is that it's not a blog with an underlying purpose like promoting a product or gaining ad revenue. Instead, it's just a way for someone to express themselves to the world. 

Even though I've read handfuls of personal blogs before, I never connected the dots that it's something that just anyone could do. It seemed like you have to have a really strong and cohesive message or goal to put out there if you're going to be one of those people who starts a blog. 

But it's a garden, not a farm. You plant some seeds and tend to the plants as they grow. Anyone can do it. Things don't have to be super polished. You can write a full-flown article about a topic you're interested in, or just a couple bullet points about an idea you recently had. 


### What makes it a digital garden and not a blog?
Maybe it's both?

But a digital garden has an emphasis on a few things:
- Posts don't have to be perfectly polished - they can be incomplete or in-progress at any given moment
- Posts aren't viewed as untouchable pieces of work - they can be changed and updated over time
- Posts aren't organized chronologically like in a typical blog. The preferred method of navigation is through categories or tags, or through backlinks from posts to posts.

[This article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) goes into more detail about some of these points, and is worth a read if you're interested.


### What do I hope for a reader to get out of this site?
Perhaps:
- Be entertained
- Discover new resources, ideas, interests, or concepts
- Understand me better and have a glimpse into how my mind works

### What do I hope for myself to get out of this site?
See [[Meta/On Blogging/Reasons to Write (Here)\|Reasons to Write (Here)]]

### How did I make this site?
I use a text editor called Obsidian, which makes it easy to have a hierarchy of many interconnected notes, and publish to Github Pages. Also see [[Meta/Obsidian Setup\|Obsidian Setup]].
