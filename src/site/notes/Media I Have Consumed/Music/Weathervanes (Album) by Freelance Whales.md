One of my favorite albums ever. After I started being more intentional about discovering new music, this was one of the first albums that clicked with me as a whole. I like basically every song on the album. The songs are emotional, gentle, "vibey". Combination of lovely lyrics and chill musicality.

Listening to it now, it gives me a nostalgia for the time period when I first started listening to it - in 2022 (so I have strongest associations of it with the feeling of junior year of college and the summer I spent in NYC after it). I think I can remember the exact moment when I listened to the album for the first time -- I was in the room of my university apartment, either working on a jigsaw puzzle that was on my floor^[(it would've been the 1000 piece puzzle of my face that my friends gifted me as a birthday gift...)] or folding laundry.

If I recall correctly, the way I found the album was actually through an Instagram reel (unless it was Tiktok? But I don't remember using Tiktok back then) that had a clip from the first song, and it captured my interest so I looked up the album and listened to it.

Top songs:
- Generator First Floor
- Location
- Broken Horse
- Ghosting
- Generator Second Floor
- The Great Estates

Honorable mention to (all of the others):
- Hannah
- Starring
- Kilojoules
- We Could be Friends

There's a couple other tracks which are purely instrument so I'm not listing them, but they are vibe-y too.

The band does have another album called Diluvia but I've only listened to it a couple times and I didn't like it as much. Unfortunately, the band has not made new music since 2014. Sadly one of the band's members, Chuck Criss (brother of Darren Criss), died in 2022.
