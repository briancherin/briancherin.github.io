by Robert Jordan, and last three books by Brandon Sanderson after Robert Jordan's death.

Fantastic series. It's epic fantasy. Thirteen books (plus maybe a prequel?). I've been listening to them in audiobook form - can't imagine consuming this series in any other way. The narrators of the audiobooks are great (there's one male and female narrator, consistent across all the books in the series). I would've been really sad if the voice actors changed partway through the series, so I'm glad they kept it consistent.

At the time of writing this, I am midway through the second to last book. I'll probably finish them all this year. 

### On Audiobooking
I treat audiobooks very differently than books (that I read with my eyes). I have a daily book-reading habit before bed, and sometimes (usually if I'm sick and don't want to use my eyes) I do audiobook before bed. But I can go large phases of time without listening to audiobooks at all, even if I'm in the middle of listening to the book. In the past, I might've gone months or longer without touching the audiobook. It usually gets to a point in the book, though, where a lot of action is happening and I can't put it down. It's not fully a boredom situation though -- I just don't strive to maintain the audiobook-listening habit.

That's changed a little bit in recent months, though. Maybe it's just because I'm at the exciting end of WoT when everything is coming together, or maybe it's because of life circumstances (recently moved to a new apartment^[I'm writing this Jan 2026 so it's been 6 months in new apartment but still], going on more walks in the park, winter months so I've been sick a couple of times). But I've pretty consistently been working through the audiobooks. I'm not sure what I'll do once I finish WoT - if I'll take a break from audiobooks or start another series (likely another long fantasy series. It seems I like to do those in audiobook form).


### On The Writing
The writing is really good. Character development is really good. The way Robert Jordan weaves together plots over long spans of time is really amazing. It feels great when plotlines resolve and things come together finally. These books give so many moments like that.
