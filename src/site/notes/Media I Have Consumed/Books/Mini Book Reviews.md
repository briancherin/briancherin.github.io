*Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West* by Gregory Maguire (Finished January 3, 2026)
- Very different than the musical/movie which were inspired by this book. I liked it a lot. In my opinion, it's a stronger story and better writing than the musical. I was told the book was darker, and that definitely comes through.
