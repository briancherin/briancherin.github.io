# Watching the 2006 proshot with Raúl Esparza
Before I get into this... Start with some not really relevant, (semi)comic relief with some randomish statements about what has occurred prior to me starting to write here:
>[!INFO]- Tangent
>- Raúl Esparza was born in October 1970, making him just having turned 36 when the 2006 revival opened on Broadway in November of 2006. The show is about the character Robert turning 35. Almost a perfect lineup but it's close - anyway I was just doing the mental math when I saw his age and it struck me as kind of funny.
>- Multiple layers to this one
>	- The main actor's name is Raúl (as established)
>	- When searching out which video of this show to watch, I think some things said Raul without the accent over the u.
>	- So in my head, his name was Raul, rhyming with Paul (I'm jumping ahead of myself with the way I phrased that). Same as the main character of Endymion books (in the Hyperion series), whose name is Raul (with no accent).
>	- I realized that Company Raul was actually Raúl, pronounced Ra-Ewl
>	- Then I got concerned that the Endymion character was actually also Ra-Ewl. But then I sought out a clip from the audiobook and confirmed Rawl -- Not to mention, the explicit line in the book says "My name is Raul Endymion. My first name rhymes with Paul.". Relief.

Anyway.

## What led up to this
Well, a couple months ago I exposed myself to Into the Woods (another Sondheim musical) and developed a strong appreciation for it. And so I've been interested in exposing myself to more Sondheim content. Into the Woods was my first exposure to his work.

My intention was to next watch a proshot of Sweeney Todd, but I kept putting it off, and it seemed like I was going to finally watch it soon. But media death and murder isn't strongly calling to me right now (I almost wish I delay it until next Halloween, but it being December right now, that is very far away, and I don't think I can hold myself back until then). 

But yesterday, I was in a place where people sing theater songs, and two songs from Company were played. So I took that as a cue for this to be my next exploration. And so my lazy Christmas day activity, admittedly in a slightly sleep-deprived state as a result of having gone to bed at an abnormally late hour last night, was to watch the Company 2006 proshot.

I came in with no context, except for having heard two of the songs karaoke-style, and I didn't catch most of the lyrics during that. (But I heard enough that my interest in the musical quality was piqued -- specifically the songs were "Another Hundred People" and "Getting Married Today" (or at least snippets of them).

I'm writing this (initially at least) right after watching it, so these are somewhat raw thoughts. I'm sure my thoughts will evolve over time, assuming I re-listen to the soundtrack and contemplate the material further.


## Overall thoughts
I liked it. I get why it won Tonies^[(Tonys? Tony's? Tonys'? Tonies.)]. I feel like I still have a lot to process about it.

Unsurprisingly (given Into the Woods), Sondheim's lyrics are a strong and captivating force. Intricate, rich, sometimes dense (in a good way). I want, need, to listen to the soundtrack again to fully absorb and appreciate it. I feel like I'm at an interesting spot right now, especially to be writing about it, because I've only listened through once -- usually my understanding of the songs and overall material changes once I've listened multiple times, and connect things together. Maybe what I'm saying is that I sense this is here -- I sense the richness of the lyrics, music, and how they tie together with the book, and know that the experience will be enriched by repeat exposure.

This proshot isn't of the original Broadway cast -- but I don't think there is any recording of that. I was skeptical about this recording at first because it's staged with the actors also playing instruments. But it's actually kind of cool, and the actors are great actors. It's also a very simple set compared to the original, based on what I briefly read, and I haven't looked at what the original looked like, but I think it came through well. It was elegant. The story came to life. 

I saw many comments praising this recording, and particularly Raúl Esparza's performance. I see it. Raúl was fantastic. He *is* the character to me -- he embodies it that well. (But often any first exposure to a show would make me say that for any and all characters -- but I sense he plays it especially well. It feels natural, like he is really the character and not an actor playing a character. When the metaphorical curtain rises and the no-longer-character actors bow, I find myself saying, "oh, could it be possible that this person does not actually fully embody the elements of the character from this show?" and then I blink and remember that this person is just doing a job and they are just really good at that job) - what I'm saying is that he's a good actor. (But for all I know, Esparza does fully embody the character in his real life. Shrug.)


## Unstructured thoughts
- Thoughts on a couple songs
	- Another Hundred People - I liked the effect of dialogue interspersed between choruses
	- Getting Married Today - FAST lyrics
- It's a non-linear show. I like it.
- Some moments of really good storytelling -- praise to the book. Specifically noted this for the butterfly and baby-oil stories.
- Natural comedy - doesn't feel like forced jokes. It's situational comedy, done well.
  

## Lines from the book that stood out to me
- "Whenever Robert's over I get this feeling we're auditioning for him" --> "well you know my favorite quote, the unexamined life is not worth living" --> " and mine is, the unlived life is not worth examining"
- "You were always outside looking in the window when everyone else was inside dancing at the party"
- "You're a terribly attractive man. The kind of man most women want but never seen to get"
- Last song
	- "How do you know so much about it when you've never been there? It's so much better living it than looking at it."
	- "Someone force me to care"
