Blog that talks about associations between their travel memories and specific music/albums/artists. I could see myself doing something similar with music associations. [https://mfranchi.net/posts/springs-best-25/](https://mfranchi.net/posts/springs-best-25/) (12/14/2025)

"This is why I’m not afraid to take my own case to trial because even if I fail or even if I fight and lose, —at least I fought for you." https://thewrittenaddiction.com/2025/12/15/all-for-more-or-less-35/ -- Seems like a poetry-based blog. Slogan of the site is "Where I go to leave pieces of me". I like that. (12/16/2025)

[Reddit post]([https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/s/McERR2iApm](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/s/McERR2iApm)) I found via Google search query "writing a proustian memoir site:reddit.com". (Entitled "Scraping training data for your mind"). Described a writer (Karl Ove Knausgaard’) who was read Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, supposedly very quickly (the post seems to imply in one sitting, but given it's 4000 pages in total, I am dubious), and then was inspired by it and it influenced his writing style. I liked some other aspects of the post as well. (I read In Search of Lost Time a few years ago. It took me 1.5 years to get through (it didn't really need to have taken that long, but the combination of a) challenging material, b) boring at times, c) my reading habit was not very strong (possibly because I was focusing strongly on just getting through this - see (a) and (b))).
